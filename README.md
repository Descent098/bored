# Bored

As part of CPSC 581 (human computer interactions) we were asked to create a project around the theme of a button.

Specifically we were asked to develop a project that rethinks what a button is, and turn it into an interaction that is more idiomatic. For my groups we chose Bored, a system that helps you pick breakfast restaurants in your area.

It was developed over the course of a day-ish after the planning stages, and is best used on mobile.

For more details there is a write-up available on my [cpsc-581 portfolio site](https://kieranwood.ca/581-portfolio-site/projects/Bored.html), and there is a demo video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TihQxpczCNM).
